# ColaMD Mercury

> A free, elegant Markdown editor for humans and AI agents — with real-time sync for AI-generated changes.

Markdown has become the de facto standard for writing, note-taking, documentation, and collaboration in the age of AI. Yet many computers still don't have a free, beautiful, capable Markdown reader/editor.

That's why I built ColaMD — an open-source, free, lightweight, and elegant Markdown editor.

First and foremost, it is a simple, focused, capable Markdown editor: true WYSIWYG editing, themes, rich-text copy, smart line breaks, PDF export, and support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

At the same time, ColaMD is friendly to AI agents. When Claude Code, Codex, Cola, or another agent edits an open `.md` file, ColaMD syncs the changes in real time. No closing the file, reopening it, or manual refresh.

Since launching a few months ago, we have received enthusiastic feedback from the community. Thank you to everyone who has submitted Issues and Pull Requests, tested ColaMD, shared feedback, or joined the discussions. ColaMD is still growing — download it, try it, and tell us what you want it to become.

Our goal is clear: make ColaMD the best free Markdown editor, and make it a reliable foundation for Markdown workflows in the age of AI.

If ColaMD is useful to you, please give the project a ⭐ Star.

## Works with your Markdown workflow

ColaMD does not ask you to change your habits. It works well alongside Obsidian, Typora, VS Code, and other Markdown apps — all sharing the same `.md` files, with each tool doing what it does best.

## Download

| Windows  | `.exe` |
| Linux    | `.AppImage` / `.deb` |

## What ColaMD Does NOT Do

ColaMD is intentionally simple:

- No cross-directory file tree or workspace (same-directory Markdown file list only)
- No cloud sync or collaboration
- No AI features built in — it's a **viewer/editor** for AI-generated content
- No plugin system

One thing, done well.

## Custom Themes

ColaMD supports custom CSS themes. Download themes from the [`themes/`](themes/) folder, or create your own and import via **Theme > Import Theme**.

Imported themes are saved to `~/.colamd/themes/` and persist across sessions.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marswaveai/colamd.git
cd colamd
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:linux
```

### Tech Stack

- **Electron** — Cross-platform desktop
- **Milkdown** — WYSIWYG Markdown (ProseMirror-based)
- **TypeScript** — Strict mode
- **electron-vite** — Fast builds

## Roadmap

ColaMD will evolve alongside the agent ecosystem:

- v1.1 — Live file reload, file associations, drag & drop, themes
- v1.2 — New icon
- v1.3 — Agent activity indicator, Cmd+click links, rich text copy, smart line breaks, PDF export, theme persistence
- v1.6 — Robust live sync: atomic-save (rename) detection, watcher self-recovery, spellcheck off
- v1.6.1 — Editable task lists (click / ⌘+Enter), ==highlight== syntax, Markdown cheatsheet
- v1.6.2 — Remove HTML export
- v1.7 — Same-directory file list: switch files in place, live updates when agents create/remove files; search (⌘F) + LaTeX (⌘⇧E) from community PR #14
- v1.7.1 — Task checkbox click fix, centered SVG checkmark, titlebar file-panel toggle button
- v1.7.2 — Playable demo page: Help → 新功能演示 (⌘⇧D), a real directory showcasing each release's features
- v1.7.3 — Demo page becomes a cumulative changelog: resources/demo/changelog.md records every release, opening straight into it (current)
- Future — More templates, bidirectional sync, cross-directory file browsing
